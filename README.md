# Description
`mu_sick_bot` is a discord music bot and a passion project coded by [m4ch374](https://github.com/m4ch374) and [n0t-4m17h](https://github.com/n0t-4m17h).

As music bots such as Groovy and Rythm ended their service, we thought:  
> If we don't have one, we gon' make one - Sun Tsu (probably)

And thats how the `mu_sick_bot` was born.  
The `mu_sick_bot` mainly focuses on music playing features but it also provides other commands.
